# web-voting-sys
## Description
We will be developing an electronic voting system that enables voters to vote securely from remote sites (rather than centralized polling sites). The system will be configurable, allowing users to specify candidates, total votes available, and a date range for voting. The winning number of votes can be determined without waiting until all votes are casted, like in presidential elections.
We will build a web-based implementation that is robust, user-friendly, and deployable. The system will include a user interface showing the voting results (e.g., the final votes each candidate received and the winning candidate and possibly the vote statistics by geographic locations or political regions) for which visualizations can be employed to enhance the understanding of results. 
## Team
The team will be comprised of Kyler Little, Lance Hoffmann, Jeff Kremer, Tony Yockey, Robert Belter, and Nicholas Vasicek.
